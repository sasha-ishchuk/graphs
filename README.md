# graphs
Tasks with algorithms and data structures (UJ, Computer Science, 4 SEM).

The following implementations have been completed as tasks on my Algorithms and Data Structure lessons.
Sample graphs, placed in .txt files, were proposed by my lecturer during the classes.
The "GraphInterface" file has been modified from the cpp header file, placed on the Pegaz platform (UJ e-learning platform) by the lecturer as a reference point.
